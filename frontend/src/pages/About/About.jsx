        <p>
          Welcome to MakeFriends, a web application developed as a part of my journey to master the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). MakeFriends allows users to connect with one another, add and remove friends. This project showcases my proficiency in various technologies and
          demonstrates my ability to build a functional and interactive web application
